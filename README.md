Nucleotides are the building blocks of nucleic acids [deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and Ribonucleic acid (RNA)] 

In DNA, there are four types of nucleotide: A, T, C, and G - Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine, Guanine. Each letter is called a base. Two bases are bonded together, they are called a base pair. 

DNA is made up of two strands and read from 5' to 3' (forward strand) and the 3' to 5' (reverse strand)
